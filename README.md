# CompPrograms

## Programming Stuff ##
* Homebrew (This is a package manager use it to install everything possible - Every library or coding thing you use will be through brew because its awesome).
* Git (in terminal: brew install git)
* iterm2 (in terminal: brew cask install iterm2)
* Python (in iterm2: brew install python3) (use python3 to actually get python 3)
* Java (brew cask install java)
* zsh (brew install zsh) (then go through these steps to use the zsh you installed https://rick.cogley.info/post/use-homebrew-zsh-instead-of-the-osx-default/)
* oh-my-zsh (google it and install it)

* Sign up for a jetbrains student thing (Free IDE for everything you could imagine)
* Sign up for a github student thing (Free private repos learn git asap and save everything you write onto github)

## Nice things ##
* Zeplin (help with UI design - https://zeplin.io/)
* Visual Studio Code (Free text editor) (this is my favorite but atom and sublime text3 are both really good too)
* Git Kraken (Git GUI) (I don't use this but it can help you learn git. Just try and use git in terminal/iterm then if you break everything use this)
* Specticles (This is to help with window resizing, brillaint - https://www.spectacleapp.com/)
* Postman (Helps when you need to make API calls / Look at an endpoints data)
* Alfred (Spotlight replacement - https://www.alfredapp.com/)

## IDEs #
* You'll start learning Java with eclipse which is fine but these will be nice later on
* IntelliJ (Java super powerful IDE, Andriod Studio is a fork of this made more specifically for mobile dev)
* PyCharm (Python IDE, good for learning python but you can just do python in Visual Studio Code and compile in command line)
* XCode (Swift / Objective C iOS development) (Can get the AppCode extension from JetBrains too to help learn)
* Android Studio (Android Development)
* Tons of these, just personal preference

Definately more that im forgetting.

Some of this has some setup hit me up if you need any help and use HOMEBREW for everything possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
